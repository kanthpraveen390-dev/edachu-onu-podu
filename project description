The Simple Bill Calculator using Operators and Input & Output is a Python program developed to calculate the total bill amount for a purchased item based on user inputs. The program accepts the item price and quantity to compute the subtotal, then applies tax and discount percentages to determine the final bill amount.

This project uses basic input and output operations along with arithmetic operators to perform real-life billing calculations accurately. The calculated details such as subtotal, tax amount, discount amount, and total payable amount are displayed clearly to the user.

The project helps beginners understand how Python can be used to solve practical problems and simulates a real-world billing system. It also improves logical thinking and strengthens fundamental programming skills by implementing simple calculations in an organized manner.
